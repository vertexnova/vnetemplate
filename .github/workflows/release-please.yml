# Release Please: auto CHANGELOG + version bump + tag on merge of release PR
# Use Conventional Commits (or PR titles): feat:, fix:, perf:, docs:, chore:, ci:
#
# If your org disables "Read and write permissions" for GITHUB_TOKEN, add a
# Personal Access Token (repo scope) as repository secret REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN;
# this workflow will use it so release-please can create/update PRs.
